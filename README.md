### HTML and CSS
Inside of vscode use "Open in Default Browser" marketplace extension. Ctrl + 1 to view hypertext markup language and css styling. 

The html file can be uploaded to a server and domain for public viewing, or a private APACHE or XAMPP server for local hosting and viewing.

### PHP
Important note! PHP pages can only be viewed when uploaded onto a server. For development, XAMPP as a localhost server may be used.
